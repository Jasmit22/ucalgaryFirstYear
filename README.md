# Calgary First Year

Calgary First Year helps first year UofC students navigate life as school approaches. We know it can be a bit strange coming to University for the first time if you know nothing about it. 

## Tech Stack

We used Next.js with several front-end utility libraries such as Tailwind and Daisy UI for this website.

MongoDB is our preferred database.

## API Acknowledgements

Thank you to the official Transit app which granted us access to their API for this project. We used the API to help students navigate to campus. Although it only takes a few days to memorize your transit route, it can be a bit difficult for students in remote areas near the beginning.


## Features

- Several Static FAQ Pages, which will most likely be the most used.
- A reviews page which stores each individual review and ensures each user can only leave 1 review.
- A go-to page which customizes the route from a user's location to provide real time, detailed Transit data.
- A compilation of informational pages from the University all put into 1 place.
- Addition of course requests automated after review (bulk add script).
- Profanity and inappropriate input sanitization.
- Google Analytics / API integration.
